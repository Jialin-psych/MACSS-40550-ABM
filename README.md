# MACSS 40550 ABM
 ABM course in MACSS program taught Spring 2025. 

 Each week has a separate folder, skill, and model / component that we'll cover. Readings are outlined in the syllabus here and in Canvas, and are all included in Canvas modules. The code used for exercies in class is hosted here, organized by week. I will update this repository as the quarter goes on, so please note new commits.

 Other: you might want to skim through this [intro to Mesa](https://mesa.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorials/intro_tutorial.html).
