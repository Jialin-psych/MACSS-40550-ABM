# MACSS 40550 ABM
 ABM course in MACSS program taught Spring 2024. 

 Each week has a separate folder, skill, and model / component that we'll cover. Readings are below, including models / code are here. 

 Textbook: You MAY find the following text helpful, but note that it covers NetLogo instead of using Python: Agent-Based and Individual-Based Modeling: A Practical Introduction, Second Edition. ISBN: 0691190836

 Other: you might want to skim through this [intro to Mesa](https://mesa.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorials/intro_tutorial.html).
 Note that we have a [cheatsheet here (frequently updated)](https://github.com/jmclip/MACSS-40550-ABM/blob/main/cheat_sheets/mesa_cheatsheet.md).
