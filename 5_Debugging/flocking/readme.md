# Flockers

An implementation of Craig Reynolds's Boids flocker model. Agents (simulated birds) try to fly towards the average position of their neighbors and in the same direction as them, while maintaining a minimum distance. This produces flocking behavior.

## Exercise objectives:
How to implement options -- what do you prioritize with limited time? 
    * Visualization
    * Metrics
    * Model

## How to Run

BE SURE TO INSTALL REQUIREMENTS FIRST! If you don't see the visualization, check that you have the requirements installed in your virtual environment!
```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Launch the model:
```
    python run.py
```

Then open your browser to [http://127.0.0.1:8521/](http://127.0.0.1:8521/) and press Reset, then Run.
